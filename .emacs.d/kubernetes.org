* Kubernetes
Sometimes I use Emacs to interact with Kubernetes, but not often. I don't include this file in my standard Emacs init, but will run these source blocks as and when I want to access Kubernetes from with Emacs.
** Kubernetes overview package

(defun ak/parse-json-logs ()
  (interactive)
  (json-mode)
  (read-only-mode -1)
  (beginning-of-buffer)
  (search-forward "{")
  (let ((start (- (point) 1)))
    (end-of-buffer)
    (search-backward "}")
    (narrow-to-region start (+ 1 (point))))
