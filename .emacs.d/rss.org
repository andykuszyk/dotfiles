* Install elfeed
I use the =elfeed= to consume RSS feeds in Emacs, because it seems like the most popular one.
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(use-package elfeed :ensure t)
#+end_src
* Feeds
I mainly use RSS for news. Here is the BBC
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq
 elfeed-feeds
 '(("http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml" world)
   ("http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml" politics)))
#+end_src
* Feed filter
I prefer to filter out unsavoury content that I have no interest in reading. The below is a list of keywords that are excluded from my feeds. They are stored base64 encoded in this file to avoid offending the casual reader (the keywords are unpleasant, because I wish to avoid unpleasant news).
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq-default
 elfeed-search-filter (base64-decode-string "
QDEtd2Vlay1hZ28KK3VucmVhZCAKIWRlYWQKIWRlYXRoCiFraWxsCiFjaGlsZAohZ2lybAohYm95

#+end_src
