* Environment variables
Some configuration of Emacs' environment is required to make some packages work correctly (for example ~go-mode~).
** Copy environment from default shell
My default shell (~zsh~) is configured to work correctly for lots of common tasks, so the simplest way to configure Emacs' environment in the same way is to inherit its environment from a shell session:
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :ensure t
  :config
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
  (exec-path-from-shell-copy-envs (list "GOROOT" "GOPATH")))
#+end_src
