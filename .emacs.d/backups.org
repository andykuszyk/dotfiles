* Backup file configuration
I prefer to save backup files in ~/tmp~, rather than alongside the files being backed-up:
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq backup-directory-alist `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
(setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))
#+end_src
