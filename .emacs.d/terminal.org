* Terminal emulation
I routinely use Emacs as a terminal emulator, for which I use the ~vterm~ package. I've found it to be very fast, and to support all manner of terminal use-cases. It transforms Emacs into a fully-fledged terminal emulator, and allows you to make use of all of Emacs' great window and buffer management tools.
#+begin_src elisp :results none
;; vterm terminal emulator
(use-package vterm :ensure t)
(use-package multi-vterm :ensure t)
(defun ak/vterm-hook()
  (display-line-numbers-mode -1)
  (hl-line-mode -1))
(add-hook 'vterm-mode-hook #'ak/vterm-hook)
(add-hook 'multi-vterm-mode-hook #'ak/vterm-hook)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x v") #'vterm)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x m") #'multi-vterm)
#+end_src
** Function to rename vterm buffer based on current directory
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(defun ak/rename-vterm-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (rename-buffer (format "*vterm-%s*" (pwd)) t))
#+end_src
