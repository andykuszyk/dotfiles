* Package management
I use ~use-package~ to install and configure packages, and install packages from MELPA.
** MELPA
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src
** ~use-package~
This might not be necessary in the latest versions of Emacs, but I've included it for posterity:
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))
#+end_src
