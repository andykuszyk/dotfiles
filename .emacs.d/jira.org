* Jira
Sometimes I use Jira professionally, and I have a couple of packages that make working with Jira from Emacs easier.
** Jira CLI
This package facilitates interacting with the Jira CLI from within Emacs:
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(when (file-directory-p "~/repos/andykuszyk/jira-cli.el")
  (use-package jira-cli
    :load-path "~/repos/andykuszyk/jira-cli.el/"
    :bind (("C-x j j" . jira-cli))))
#+end_src
** ob-jira-markdown
I like to write and edit Jira issues as org-babel source blocks, and this package lets me easily create and edit issues directly from org-mode:
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(when (file-directory-p "~/repos/andykuszyk/ob-jira-markdown.el")
  (use-package ob-jira-markdown
    :load-path "~/repos/andykuszyk/ob-jira-markdown.el/"
    :bind (("C-x j o" . ob-jira-markdown-open-in-browser)
	   ("C-x j w" . ob-jira-markdown-kill-issue))))
#+end_src
