* MacOS-specific configuration
** Start fullscreen
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(toggle-frame-maximized)
#+end_src
** Use ~gman~ to avoid slow man page lookups
~man~ lookups on Mac OS are very slow, so I use ~gman~ (obtained from ~brew install man-db~) instead. This solves the lookup problem, but does require the ~man~ database to be rebuilt after installing new packages, with ~mandb~.
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq manual-program "gman")
#+end_src
** Always open new windows by splitting vertically
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq split-height-threshold 1000) ; this essentially means that splitting horizontally is not possible
#+end_src
