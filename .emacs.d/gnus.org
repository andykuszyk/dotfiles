** Gnus wishlist [6/8]
*** DONE see all fastmail imap folders in gnus
CLOSED: [2025-11-28 Fri 17:43]
This can be done from the group buffer with =L= (=gnus-group-list-all-groups=)
*** DONE be able to read historical messages
CLOSED: [2025-11-28 Fri 17:48]
Either open a folder that is read, and the messages will be displayed, or use =/ o= from the summary buffer.
*** DONE be able to search historical messages
CLOSED: [2025-11-28 Fri 18:02]
Use =G G= to search the group on the current line.
To search all groups, mark all of them with =M b= and then search them with =G G=.
*** DONE be able to mark a message as read, and this be reflected on the imap server
CLOSED: [2025-11-28 Fri 17:44]
This happens automatically when the message is read, but you have to sync Gnus with the server with =g= from the group buffer
*** DONE be able to delete a message, and this be reflected on the imap server
CLOSED: [2025-11-28 Fri 17:43]
By default this can be achieved with =B DEL= (=gnus-summary-delete-article=)
