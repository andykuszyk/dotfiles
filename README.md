# Andy Kuszyk's dotfiles
This repo contains the dotfiles that I use for Linux desktop configuration. Most of them relate to my use of i3, at which I am a beginner - this repo is not a primary source of i3 information!

More information about my use of i3 can be found in my [blog post](https://andykuszyk.github.io/2020-02-18-demystifying-i3.html) on the subject.
